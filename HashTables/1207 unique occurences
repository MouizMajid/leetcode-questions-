/*
    I gave up on this question. The solution has been copied. 
    Here is the explanation of the solution.

    1. Create a frequency map to count occurrences of each integer in the array.
    2. Use a HashSet to track unique occurrence counts. 
    3. If the size of the frequency map (number of unique integers) equals the size of 
        the HashSet (number of unique occurrence counts), then all occurrences are unique.
    4. Return true if they are equal, otherwise return false.
